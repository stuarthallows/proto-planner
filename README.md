# 🏗️ Proto Planner

A playground application for experimenting with modern development technologies in the context of an enterprise ERP system. This project implements a microservices architecture with domain-driven design principles, focusing on inventory and sales management services.

## 🎯 Overview

This application serves as a technology experimentation platform, exploring various patterns and frameworks in a realistic enterprise ERP domain. The system demonstrates microservices architecture where each business domain is implemented as an independent service while sharing infrastructure concerns.

## 🏛️ Architecture

The application uses a .NET Aspire host to orchestrate multiple microservices:

- **ProtoPlanner.AppHost**: .NET Aspire orchestration host
- **Module.Inventory.ApiService**: Inventory management using FastEndpoints 
- **Module.Sales.ApiService**: Sales management using minimal APIs
- **ProtoPlanner.Web**: React TypeScript frontend
- **ProtoPlanner.ServiceDefaults**: Shared service configuration

### Microservices Design Principles

When defining microservices, consider:
- How the services communicate (integration events)
- How data is shared between services
- How to handle eventual consistency
- Treating each service as an independent application

## Workflow
- Start working on an app with a dictation session in SuperWhisperer
- Work with Claude to turn that into a requirements document
- Tell Claude code to create GitHub issues, issues need to be really well defined
- Install GitHub CLI to enable Claude to interact with GitHub
- Setup Playwright MCP server so Claude can test the code it writes
- Setup CI to run the test suite
- Review the PR and leave comments
- Have Claude perform a PR review, clear the context first or use a separate terminal
- Have Claude action the comments
- Merge the PR
- Clear the context
- Consider using Git worktrees to work on multiple issues simultaneously

Question: Should Claude commit the code, or should the developer?



What works surprisingly well in my workflow definition is to ask Claude to self assess confidence/familiarity of the area in the planning phase and if it's below 70 (1-100 scale), it does a spike/POC and much more research before proceeding to implementing.
