It should be possible to treat each module as a separate application.

Defining the modules is difficult and important.

When defining modules consider
- how the modules communicate
- how will data be shared
- how to deal with eventual consistency

How to structure the code within a module;
- Clean architecture
- Layered architecture
- Vertical slices
